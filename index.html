                    <h2>WHO ARE WE?</h2>
                    <p>Some of you may call us life saviors, for some we may be the only source of hope. But in reality,
                        we are just an organization of over 1000 active & dedicated members having a common goal-
                        “Striving for the betterment of our motherland by fully indulging ourselves in the service of
                        mankind”. NSS IIT Roorkee is the largest student-body group of IIT Roorkee that brings an
                        entirely new dimension to this prestigious institute. We are an organization consisting of 10
                        well-coordinated cells through which we keep on contributing to several domains of social
                        service. Of the many things that make us who we are, what drives us from within is what inspires
                        us to work. Driven by a strong urge to help the needy, supplemented with great support from the
                        students and sponsors, we aim to continue creating an impact on the lives of many thereby
                        following our motto- NOT FOR ME, BUT FOR THE NATION!
                    </p>
                    <h2>WHAT WE DO?</h2>
                    <p>WHAT WE DO?

                        We hope to make a change in our society on a national level by inculcating thoughts of social
                        welfare among the people. We wish towards building a beautiful world and spreading the message
                        of environmental preservation, peace and education among today's youth. NSS IIT Roorkee works on
                        a diverse range of social issues including blood donation, spreading awareness, environmental
                        issues, spreading education at all levels, etc. We also collaborate with several NGOs in and
                        around. NSS IIT Roorkee primarily aims to work for the betterment of society and instill the
                        spirit of social service among the young students. It organizes blood donation camps, AIDS

                        topics, and other such events regularly at all levels. We have many cells under us like-

                            <li>Primary Education</li>
                            <li>Event Management and Promotion</li>

                        <p>All these cells collectively work together to help in the development and growth in all
                            areas.
                            Thus we work with a single thought in our minds:</p>
